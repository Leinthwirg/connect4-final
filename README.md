# connect4-final

Connect4 is a two player game.  The goal is to win by placing 4 of your tokens in a row
either horizontally, vertically, diagonally. 
Tokens are dropped into one of 7 slots in the top.  The tokens drop to the lowest 
unfilled row or to the bottom (sixth) row. 

Game development will proceed along these lines.
HTML and layout
tricky setcell(x,y,player) and clearcell(x,y) routines
add a dropzone with some kind of cool hover effect
win detection
score keeping
new game 
clear scores


I'll probably want to keep the game state in some sort of multi-dimensional array.
